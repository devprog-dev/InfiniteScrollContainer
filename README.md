# InfiniteScrollContainer
When you have to show a lot of items, instead of continuously generating nodes, you only need to change the data with a set node.

If you download the project, you don't need to set it up.

If you need to set options
![touch enable](~@godot_InfiniteScrollContainer/jungleprog/Asset/option.png)
